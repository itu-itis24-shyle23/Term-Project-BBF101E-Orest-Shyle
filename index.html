            Hello there! My name is <b>Orest Shyle</b> and I am an international student coming from the small but proud country of <b>Albania.</b> Growing up I always dreamed about becoming a successful <b>Computer engineer</b>, because I think it has a bright future. That is why I have worked hard for many years to earn a scholarship and come to the college of my dreams, <b>Istanbul Technical University</b>. I am exited to see what the future stores for me and I am also ready to overcome every obstacle that may occur between me and success. That's all about me, now you can enjoy the game I created by clicking the button below.
